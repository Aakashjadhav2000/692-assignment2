Traffic Signal System Implementation in C Report
1. Project Overview
  •	This project showcases the development of a sophisticated traffic signal control system, meticulously coded in C to significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of intersections. Harnessing the robust capabilities of the C programming language, our team has successfully engineered a solution that seamlessly integrates with existing traffic management infrastructures. This integration is designed to effectively manage traffic flow and alleviate congestion, marking a notable advancement in urban traffic control.

2.	Objective
  •	The primary goal of this initiative was to architect a traffic signal system that not only underscores the performance and reliability of C but also offers a scalable and adaptable framework. This framework is envisioned to not only streamline current traffic management practices but also accommodate future advancements in traffic control technologies and standards, thereby contributing to the evolution of urban traffic systems.
  
3.	Implementation Strategy
  •	Our approach to implementation was comprehensive, targeting several pivotal aspects essential for a robust traffic signal system. These included:
    a)	Signal Timing Control: We formulated sophisticated algorithms to regulate the timing of green, yellow, and red signals. These algorithms take into account both preset schedules and             real-time traffic data to ensure traffic flows smoothly through intersections, minimizing delays and enhancing road safety.

    b)	Hardware Interface: A series of functions were meticulously developed for seamless communication with the traffic signal hardware, ensuring signal changes are both timely and precise.

    c)	Safety Checks: To mitigate any potential signal timing conflicts and adhere to stringent traffic safety regulations, our system includes an array of safety checks. These checks are             crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of traffic signal operations.

    d)	Fault Tolerance: Recognizing the importance of system resilience, our design is capable of detecting and rectifying hardware failures and communication disruptions, thus ensuring             continuous operational integrity.
  •	In line with our thorough implementation strategy, we initially deployed our system on an emulator to rigorously test its functionality and performance. This initial phase allowed us to       identify and rectify any issues in a controlled environment, significantly reducing potential risks before the real-world application. Following successful emulation tests, we proceeded       with the deployment on the BeagleBone platform, marking a critical step towards actualizing our traffic management solution in real-world scenarios.
4. Key Features
  •	Our system is distinguished by several key features, including:
    a)	Adaptive Timing: Leveraging real-time traffic data, our system dynamically adjusts signal timings to optimize traffic flow and reduce wait times, thereby enhancing overall traffic             efficiency.
    b)	Manual Override: In cases of emergencies or special events, authorized personnel have the capability to manually override the automated signal timings, offering unparalleled                   flexibility and control.
    c)	Logging and Monitoring: An extensive logging mechanism records all system actions and traffic data, facilitating detailed monitoring and performance evaluation. This data is                   invaluable for ongoing system improvements and traffic analysis.
5.	Future Directions
    a)	Enhanced Adaptability: Plans to incorporate more advanced algorithms for adaptive signal control based on predictive modeling of traffic patterns.
    b)	Integration with Smart City Infrastructure: Exploring possibilities for integrating our system with broader smart city infrastructure for coordinated traffic management across               multiple intersections.
6.	Conclusion
  •	The development of the traffic signal system in C represents a significant step forward in our efforts to improve traffic management and safety. The system's design and implementation         focused on reliability, efficiency, and compliance with industry standards, setting a strong foundation for future enhancements.

•	MISRA Compliance Report for Traffic Signal System Implementation

1.	Introduction
  •	We undertook a review of our traffic signal system code to assess its compliance with MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) guidelines, which are critical for ensuring       the safety, reliability, and maintainability of automotive software systems.
2.	Key Findings
  •	The MISRA compliance report identified several instances where our code does not adhere to best practices as outlined by MISRA guidelines. Specifically, the report highlighted the use of       "magic numbers" in our implementation.
3.	Details of Findings
  •	Use of Magic Numbers: The report flagged specific instances where hard-coded numerical values were used in the code, notably for signal timing. These include:
  •	Yellow signal time set to 5 seconds.
  •	All-red signal time set to 2 seconds.
  •	Green signal time set to 60 seconds, used in two distinct places.
  •	These instances were flagged under the check ID "RECOMMENDED_08", indicating a recommendation against the use of magic numbers.
